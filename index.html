            <p>There are two simple projects with practice in jQuery knowledge. </p>
            <p> First is project Paint Box for practice with Draggable and Droppable widgets.
              The second project is a responsive web site of Bike shop with Datepicker and Autocomplete Widgets.</p>

            <p>This is a project with practice in Javascript knowledge.</p>
            <p>The rules are simple: Flip over cards by click. At the same time it is possible to open just two cards.
              If those cards have the same pics - they will remain opened, instead they will close.
              Player has to open the whole map.</p>
              <p>The speed of success depends on the strength of memory. As the player's pace slows down - stars on top fall down.</p>

            <p>The main goal of this project is an application with a task list, where tasks are presented in a hierarchical tree structure. This provides a more intuitive and user-friendly way for individuals to perceive complex goals.</p>

            <p>At this stage, the application displays tasks with two sub-levels of structure. In the next step, the application will be transitioned into a graphical tree structure. Below is an animation from the working project.</p>
            <p>For the project, a domain name has been acquired: <a href="https://mindsgraph.com">www.mindsgraph.com</a>, and work is currently underway to deploy it on Amazon Web Services.</p>
            <p>The project was built on:
              <ul>
                <li>Java</li>
  <li>Spring MVC framework.</li>
  <li>MySql ver 8.0</li>
